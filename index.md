# Digitized Gutenberg Bibles for the Lyell Lectures 2021

The Bodleian's [Lyell Lectures 2021 series](https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/the-lyell-lectures-2021) will be given by Paul Needham on "**The Genesis, Life, and Afterlife of the Gutenberg Bible**". To accompany the series, we have gathered together over twenty [IIIF-enabled](https://iiif.io/community/faq/) digitized copies of the Gutenberg Bible, in 34 volumes.

## Digitized copies

This collection comprises (mostly) fully-digitized copies of the Gutenberg Bible which are published by their holding instututions as IIIF objects, meaning they can be easily shared and viewed across a range of compatible applications.

Some libraries publish both volumes as a single object, others as two separate volumes. Some libraries hold only one volume.

Some digital facsimiles of the Gutenberg bible are not published as IIIF objects, and are not included here.

The digitized Gutenberg Bibles are also available as a [IIIF Collection](https://tdungate.github.io/lyell-2021/collections/lyell-gutenberg.json).
